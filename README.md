# djagno_chat_bot_api

Trained a chatbot to know information about autism. 
The code can be divided into two parts
* Machine Learnign Part
* Django Api Part

The machine learning part is present in [code_ml](https://github.com/talhaanwarch/djagno_chat_bot_api/tree/main/code_ml) whereas rest of files are django api files.
## Machine Learning part
[intents.json](https://github.com/talhaanwarch/djagno_chat_bot_api/blob/main/code_ml/intents.json) file contain the question and their responses. You can edit it according to your need.  
[code.py](https://github.com/talhaanwarch/djagno_chat_bot_api/blob/main/code_ml/code.py) contains the ML alogrithm in which features are extracted using TF-IDF and then NaiveBayes is used to classify them. Both trained classifier and vectorizers are saved as [models.p](https://github.com/talhaanwarch/djagno_chat_bot_api/blob/main/code_ml/models.p) to used in online web app.

## Django API part
[This tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/productionize-a-machine-learning-model-with-a-django-api-c774cb47698c) helped a lot to create django API



# Base API URL:
https://autiskabot.herokuapp.com/api/?question=

Add the question to baseline such as 
https://autiskabot.herokuapp.com/api/?question=What is autism 
It will generate result like this
```
{"result": "Autism is a complex, lifelong developmental disability that typically appears during early 
childhood and can impact a person's social skills, communication, relationships, and self-regulation"}
```

## Three important .txt files
* runtime.txt->> python version installed, some time heroku doesnot support the version, so you can check [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support)
* requirements.txt->> python packages required
* nltk.txt->> nltk corpus used, herko required this for working

# How to use it
Download this repository locally.  
Then in code_ml change the intent.json file according to your QnAs.   
Retrain the model using code.py and upload back to github.   
Connect heroku with github and simply in one click you can upload it.
